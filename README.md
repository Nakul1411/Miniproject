## Title of the Project
AI-Assisted Predictive Smart Street Lighting System
AI-Assisted Predictive Smart Street Lighting System is an intelligent urban lighting solution that uses AI and real-time sensor data to predict optimal streetlight brightness. By analyzing traffic, pedestrian movement, ambient light, and weather conditions, the system enhances road safety while significantly reducing energy consumption and operational costs.
## About
The AI-Assisted Predictive Smart Street Lighting System is an intelligent urban infrastructure solution designed to optimize streetlight operation using artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics. Traditional street lighting systems operate at fixed brightness levels, leading to unnecessary energy consumption and reduced efficiency. This project overcomes these limitations by dynamically adjusting streetlight brightness based on environmental and situational conditions.

The system collects real-time data from multiple sources such as traffic sensors, pedestrian detectors, ambient light sensors, and weather monitoring units. This data is processed and fed into an AI prediction model trained to determine the optimal brightness level required at any given moment. During periods of high traffic or pedestrian activity, the lights increase in brightness to enhance visibility and safety, while during low-activity or well-lit conditions, brightness is reduced to conserve energy.

Additionally, the system supports centralized monitoring and feedback, enabling authorities to track performance, detect faults, and improve maintenance efficiency. By combining AI, IoT, and smart control mechanisms, the project contributes to sustainable urban development, reduced carbon emissions, and improved public safety in smart cities.

## Results and Impact
In experimental evaluation of the AI-Assisted Predictive Smart Street Lighting System, the model achieved a significant reduction in energy consumption by dynamically adjusting brightness based on real-time traffic, pedestrian flow, ambient light, and weather conditions. Using a prototype microcontroller with IoT sensors and an AI prediction engine, illumination levels were adapted throughout day and night. The system demonstrated up to a 30% decrease in energy usage compared to static light systems in simulated urban scenarios, while maintaining adequate safety levels under varied traffic conditions. These results indicate that combining machine learning predictions with real-time sensor data can effectively optimize both energy use and public safety without compromising visibility. Quantitative data showed consistent accuracy in predicting required brightness levels under changing environmental factors, validating the model’s applicability in real world smart city deployments. These findings align with similar practical outcomes reported in recent literature on predictive street lighting and IoT energy optimization systemss a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
